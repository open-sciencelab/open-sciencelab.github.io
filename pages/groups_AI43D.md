## Group - AI43D
+ The objective for general 3D tasks encompasses accurately modeling, understanding, and manipulating the three-dimensional aspects of the physical world through computational methods. These tasks aim to reconstruct, interpret, and simulate the geometry, appearance, and dynamics of objects and environments from data captured by various sensors, such as cameras and LiDAR. Applications range from virtual and augmented reality, robotics, autonomous navigation, and cultural heritage preservation to medical imaging and product design. The overarching goal is to bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms, enabling machines to perceive and interact with the three-dimensional world as humans do, thereby enhancing the capabilities of technology to assist, augment, and automate tasks in diverse domains.

+ 三维任务的目标包括通过计算方法准确地建模、理解和操纵物理世界的三维特征。这些任务旨在重建、解释和模拟从各种传感器（如摄像机和激光雷达）捕获的数据中的对象和环境的几何形状、外观和动态。应用领域包括虚拟和增强现实、机器人技术、自主导航、文化遗产保护、医学成像和产品设计等。总体目标是弥合数字与物理领域之间的差距，使机器能够像人类一样感知和与三维世界互动，从而增强技术在多个领域协助、增强和自动化任务的能力。

## Group - Human-Centric Vision
+ We are dedicated to enabling AI to understand humans and their interactions with the world, aiming to have machines not only mimic human behaviors but also genuinely learn the ways humans perceive and understand the world, thereby mastering "human intelligence." Specific research areas include:
Human-centered perception and generation tasks: Building a unified foundational model for perception and generation that leverages self-supervised learning, large language models, diffusion models, etc., to achieve high-precision multimodal human perception, human mesh reconstruction, and human generation, addressing key issues in fields such as virtual reality and smart sports.
Humanoid world models: Developing human-level perception and action capabilities in models through the technical approach of world models by observing the ways humans interact with the world, promoting further development of virtual assistants and embodied intelligence.
Multimodal human AIGC: Researching human AIGC controlled by text, human posture sequences, and other modalities, enhancing AI's application paradigms in commercial design, video production, etc.
Multimodal large-scale pedestrian re-identification: Researching large-scale pedestrian re-identification solutions in multimodal scenarios such as text descriptions, clothing changing, infrared videos, etc., designing a unified model to complete pedestrian retrieval under any conditions, providing value to urban safety, intelligent transportation systems, retail analysis, and more.

+ 我们致力于让AI理解人类以及他们与世界的交互，旨在让机器不仅模仿人类的行为，而且真正学习到人类对世界的感知和理解方式，从而掌握“人类智能”。具体研究领域包括：
  - 以人体为中心的感知、生成任务：基于自监督学习、大语言模型、扩散模型等技术建立统一的感知生成一体化的基础模型，实现高精度的多模态人体感知、人体重建、人体生成，解决虚拟现实、智慧体育等领域的关键问题。
  - 类人世界模型：基于世界模型的技术路线，让模型通过观察人类与世界的交互方式，学习到人类级别的感知和行动能力，促进虚拟助手、具身智能的进一步发展。
  - 多模态人体视频生成：研究由文字、人体姿态序列等多种模态控制的人体视频生成，提升AI在商业设计、视频制作等方面的应用潜力。
  - 多模态大规模行人重识别：研究文字、换衣、红外等多模态场景下的大规模行人重识别方案，设计统一的模型完成任意条件下的行人检索，为城市安全、智能交通系统、零售分析等多个领域提供价值。
