# Group - AI4Science

AI for Science team is focused on the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, earth, and other sciences.Through in-depth research on the basic theories of various disciplines, combined with the latest artificial intelligence theories, we explore research paradigms for AI-driven major scientific issues and build an open ecological platform for cross-disciplinary data and algorithms from microscopic to macroscopic natural science, enabling artificial intelligence to be closely combined with natural science. Through basic and applied research, we build a complete system from underlying innovation to industrial implementation, accelerate the penetration and implementation of artificial intelligence in fields such as chemistry, new materials, meteorology, and drug research and development, and empower the development of various industries.

## Group - AI4Earth
+ Our objective is to enhance understanding of Earth system processes, encompassing the atmosphere, land surface, and oceans, among other spheres. This knowledge aims to better address significant challenges, including natural disasters such as weather events and earthquakes, as well as major issues like climate change. Employing superior data and cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies, we aspire to perceive and adapt to global challenges in weather, climate, geology, and the environment. This includes advancements in short-term, medium-term, and long-term weather forecasting, climate predictions, earthquake monitoring and early warnings, as well as carbon emissions and pollution monitoring. Through these efforts, we envision a more resilient and proactive approach to safeguarding our planet.
