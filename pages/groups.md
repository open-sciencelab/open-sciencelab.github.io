## Group - AI4Earth
+ Our objective is to enhance understanding of Earth system processes, encompassing the atmosphere, land surface, and oceans, among other spheres. This knowledge aims to better address significant challenges, including natural disasters such as weather events and earthquakes, as well as major issues like climate change. Employing superior data and cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies, we aspire to perceive and adapt to global challenges in weather, climate, geology, and the environment. This includes advancements in short-term, medium-term, and long-term weather forecasting, climate predictions, earthquake monitoring and early warnings, as well as carbon emissions and pollution monitoring. Through these efforts, we envision a more resilient and proactive approach to safeguarding our planet.

## Group - AI43D
+ The objective for general 3D tasks encompasses accurately modeling, understanding, and manipulating the three-dimensional aspects of the physical world through computational methods. These tasks aim to reconstruct, interpret, and simulate the geometry, appearance, and dynamics of objects and environments from data captured by various sensors, such as cameras and LiDAR. Applications range from virtual and augmented reality, robotics, autonomous navigation, and cultural heritage preservation to medical imaging and product design. The overarching goal is to bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms, enabling machines to perceive and interact with the three-dimensional world as humans do, thereby enhancing the capabilities of technology to assist, augment, and automate tasks in diverse domains.
