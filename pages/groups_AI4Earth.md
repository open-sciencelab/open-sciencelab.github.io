## Group - AI4Earth
+ Our objective is to enhance understanding of Earth system processes, encompassing the atmosphere, land surface, and oceans, among other spheres. This knowledge aims to better address significant challenges, including natural disasters such as weather events and earthquakes, as well as major issues like climate change. Employing superior data and cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies, we aspire to perceive and adapt to global challenges in weather, climate, geology, and the environment. This includes advancements in short-term, medium-term, and long-term weather forecasting, climate predictions, earthquake monitoring and early warnings, as well as carbon emissions and pollution monitoring. Through these efforts, we envision a more resilient and proactive approach to safeguarding our planet.

+ 我们的目标是提升对地球系统过程（包括大气，陆表和海洋等圈层）的理解以及其影响，以便更好地应对包括天气、地震等自然灾害，气候变化等重大问题。我们将使用更好的数据和更先进的人工智能技术来感知和适应全球气候、气候、地质、环境等方面面临的挑战，比如短临、短期、中长期天气预报、气候预测、地震监测与预警、碳排放与污染监测等。
